# AlfinaEngine
 AlfinaEngine is open-source wanna-be game engine written in C++.
 
 The simplest way to use this engine is to copy **Alfina** folder to your computer and include **"Alfina/alfina.h"** to your program. Note that the current windows renderer implementation is using OpenGL and requires **GLEW**.

 Usage example is provided in **project.h** and **project.cpp** files.
